## 🎨 Design Principles Used

1. **Simple Structure**: Basic HTML5 semantic tags (header, main, section, footer)
2. **Clear Class Names**: Descriptive names like `.login-card`, `.book-grid`, `.chat-area`
3. **Comments**: Helpful comments in both HTML and CSS explaining each section
4. **Separate Files**: Each HTML has its own CSS file in the same directory
5. **No Frameworks**: Pure HTML and CSS only - no JavaScript frameworks
6. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with media queries
7. **Easy to Understand**: Clear code structure, not overly complex
